# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification

**1.** **What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?**
   It's a collection of 70,000 pictures of clothes like shirts, pants, and shoes. Each picture is small (28x28 pixels) and shows one type of clothing item. We use it to train our model to recognize different clothes.
